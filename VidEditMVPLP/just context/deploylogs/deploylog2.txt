log for failed deploy

The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
[line 91](#L91)-[line 96](#L96) indicates that the build failed because a Netlify Function is using the "googleapis" dependency which has not been installed.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, the user needs to follow these steps:
1. Verify that the "googleapis" package is in the project's top-level "package.json" file or was committed to the repository.
2. Add the "googleapis" dependency to the top-level "package.json" file if it's missing.
3. Alternatively, the user can run "npm install" or "yarn" inside the Netlify Function in the build command to install the missing dependency.
4. If the above methods don't work, the user can add the "@netlify/plugin-functions-install-core" plugin to the "netlify.toml" configuration file as suggested in the build logs.

The relevant error logs are:
